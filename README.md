======

# Abstract

The Conflict-Free File System Network, or CFSNet, is a distributed,
decentralized, and peer-to-peer system for securely authoring, tracking,
and replicating content in self contained file system archives. This is
some what equivalent to how Linux file systems are distributed through Docker
containers and how the `POSIX.1-1988` Tar file format represents archive files
as binary objects (Tarballs).
